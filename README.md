# Beamline PlanForge

**PlanForge** is a modular, deterministic planning engine built around a WASM core, AI-assisted workflows, and a strict plugin architecture.

The project focuses on:
- deterministic constraint validation
- reproducible planning and pricing
- WASM-heavy core for performance and portability
- minimal frontend glue (SSR + islands)
- extensible plugin ecosystem (OSS core + commercial add-ons)

> This repository contains the open-source core of the PlanForge engine.

## Core principles

- Determinism first
- Explicit domain models
- No hidden framework magic
- Plugins over forks
- OSS core, commercial extensions

## Status

🚧 Early architecture stage (schemas, contracts, core layout).
